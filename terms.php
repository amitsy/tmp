<span id="faqq">Requirements</span><br>
<span id="faqa">In order to complete the sale of your Product to or through Take My Phone or to complete any other transaction with Take My Phone, you must: <br>
i.	Provide true, up to date and accurate account information about yourself and any Product you submit to us; <br>

In order to receive payments for any Products we purchase from you, you must provide us with information including a valid email address at which you are able to receive email, a valid postal address at which you are able to receive mail, and your first and last name.

<span id="faqq">Product Eligibility</span><br>
<span id="faqa">Take My Phone determines, in its sole discretion, which Products are eligible for purchase by or through the Take My Phone Services and for which eligible Products Take My Phone will provide an offer. Take My Phone may terminate the eligibility of certain Products at any time and without advanced notice, but such termination will not affect any Products for which you have already accepted an offer, which is good for thirty (30) days pursuant to Section 9 below.<br>
Condition Defined. Take My Phone uses three (3) basic Product conditions to grade Products, ranging from "Flawless" or “No Noticeable Flaws” to "Broken” or “Functional or physical problems." Conditions can vary widely between categories and types of Products. Broadly, Take My Phone's Product definitions are as follows: Flawless or No Noticeable flaws: the item looks like it has never been used and is 100% functional. Good or Normal wear and tear: the item has visible signs of use, but is otherwise 100% functional. Broken or Functional or physical problems: the item does not turn on, one or more Product functions is non-operative or the item has serious physical damage that inhibits use (e.g. broken or cracked screen or missing parts).  The above definitions are broad guidelines. More specific condition definitions specific to the category and/ or type of Product may be included on the Take My Phone Website offer screen and serve as the effective condition definition for that product. Condition definitions are subject to change at Take My Phone's discretion. If you are uncertain about your Product’s condition, please seek guidance by contacting Take My Phone’s customer care.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Product Valuation</span><br>
<span id="faqa">All offers will be based on Take My Phone's own determination of the Product value in reliance on the accuracy of the information you supply us. Take My Phone will use its discretion to determine the Product value, weighing factors that may include the Product's model, functionality and condition and whether necessary Product accessories have been provided by you. Upon receiving an offer, you have the option of accepting or rejecting that offer. Acceptance indicates you are willing to provide your Product to Take My Phone at the offered price. If you do not accept Take My Phone’s offer, the specific transaction expires. If after rejecting the offer you change your mind and want to accept the offer, you will need to open another transaction with us at which point, assuming the Product is still eligible for purchase, the new offer may be different as Product prices are subject to change.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Fitness for Sale; Phone and Internet Service</span><br>
 <span id="faqa">You must have all right, title, and interest in any and all Products you seek to sell to Take My Phone and all Products must be able to be activated for new service (unless the Product is incapable of being activated because it is in “Broken” condition). The Products and the sale and shipment of such items to Take My Phone: (a) must comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, including without limitation all import and export laws as described in Section 14 below, (b) may not infringe on third party intellectual property rights (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights), and (c) shall not be counterfeit, stolen, or fraudulent. You represent and warrant that the Products are free of any liens or encumbrances, including third-party software which may not be transferred or for which royalties are due. By using the Take My Phone Services, you agree to indemnify Take My Phone from all claims or losses sustained by Take My Phone as a result of any breach of these representations and warranties. It is your responsibility to discontinue phone, Internet and/or any similar service on your Product prior to selling it to Take My Phone. Take My Phone is not responsible for any service charges related to your Product, whether you incur such charges before, during or after your use of the Services. It is also your responsibility to remove any security codes that would prevent use of any Product.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Sending Take My Phone Your Product</span><br>
<span id="faqa">When packaging your Product, be sure to include all materials included in your description when we calculated your offer. This may include software, accessories, adapters, and manuals. Failure to include any items you told us about when the offer was calculated, or sending us a Product which does not match your original description, may impact the final value of your Product and may result in a revised offer.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Removing Data from Your Product</span><br>
<span id="faqa">For Products involving devices that store files and/or personal data on hard drives, memory chips or the like, you must back up and store any data you wish to keep from your Product and remove any personal information before you send your Product to us. Take My Phone’s standard practice is to remove all such data from your Product; however, Take My Phone makes no guarantee that it will do so. By sending Take My Phone your Product, you agree to release us from any claim as to the Product, the data stored in such Product, or any information on any media used in conjunction with the Product and which you send to Take My Phone, or for such data's security, integrity, confidentiality, disclosure or use. Take My Phone is not responsible for: (a) any loss suffered by you due to any data that is not erased from the device and transferred to a third party, or (b) any loss of data after you submitted your Product to us.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Product Inspection; Offer Recalculation</span><br>
<span id="faqa">Your Product must be received by Take My Phone within thirty (30) days after you accept the original offer provided by Take My Phone and complete the check- out process on the Take My Phone Website (the "Delivery Period") or the offer shall automatically expire. Packing and shipping recommendations provided to you by Take My Phone should be followed in order to avoid possible damage to or loss of the Product in transit. Take My Phone will inspect all Products that are received. Take My Phone has the option to accept or reject the Product, including without limitation, to reject any Product not conforming to the description you provided to us, any Product modified in such a way that it no longer conforms to the original factory specifications, any Product no longer complying with applicable laws or regulations (e.g., FCC rules, etc.) and/or any Product damaged or lost in transit. If Take My Phone rejects the Product for any of these reasons, the original offer automatically expires and is rescinded. Take My Phone reserves the right to revoke the original offer and provide a revised offer for the Product if: (a) the Product and/or materials are not as described, (b) the Product is received by Take My Phone after the Delivery Period, and/or (c) Take My Phone receives Product(s) that are different from those identified when your offer was calculated.</span><br>
<span id="faqq">Recalculated Product Offers after Inspection</span><br>
<span id="faqa">In the event Take My Phone recalculates the offer it provided for the Product after it has been received and inspected, as described above, you shall have the option of accepting or rejecting the new offer. If you accept the new offer, you will be paid in normal course and in accordance with these service terms. If you reject the new offer, Take My Phone will return the Product to you at the address from which it was originally sent. Take My Phone will give you a period of five (5) days after Take My Phone presents you with a recalculated offer via email at the address you provided to accept or reject the new offer (the "New Offer Period"). Take My Phone will also remind you of the outstanding new offer one or more times during the New Offer Period. However, if the new offer is neither affirmatively accepted nor rejected by you during the New Offer Period, the new offer will be deemed to have been accepted by you and you will be paid the new offer price in the normal course and in accordance with these service terms. For the avoidance of doubt, your acceptance of the original offer and/or any new offer is final and you may not change your mind later about accepting such offer.</span><br>
Releasing Rights to Product<br>
Once you send Take My Phone your Product, Take My Phone cannot and does not guarantee that it will be able to honor any request for return of the Product and/or any data or information contained in such Product. Of course, if Take My Phone rejects the Product or you do not accept any new offer for the Product pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 ("Return Circumstances"), your Product will be returned to you as set forth in Sections 9 and 10.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Risk-Of-Loss</span><br>
<span id="faqa">You remain responsible for the risk-of-loss for the Products until delivery of the same to Take My Phone. You are responsible for any damages that may occur to your Product while in transit. Take My Phone is responsible for risk-of-loss when it opens the packaging containing your Product and ceases in the event Take My Phone returns your product to you for any reason. For the avoidance of doubt, in such event, risk of loss will be transferred to you once Take My Phone delivers the package to the carrier for return to you and you will bear the risk-of-loss while the Product is in transit.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Passing of Title</span><br>
<span id="faqa">Title to the applicable Product passes to Take My Phone upon Take My Phone’s acceptance of the Product for the original offer or the new offer, as applicable. If there is a Return Circumstance, title shall not pass and shall remain with you.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Non-Transferable</span><br>
<span id="faqa">Any offer by Take My Phone for your Product is non- transferable and not redeemable for any other consideration other than what is offered by Take My Phone.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Promotions</span><br>
<span id="faqa"> From time to time, and at Take My Phone's sole discretion, Take My Phone may offer promotional programs as an incentive to customers. Promotions applicable to payments are applied as an increment to the final value of a customer's Product, but they are not considered a change in that final value. Promotional programs have explicitly defined terms, including but not limited to, expiration, usage per person and per transaction, and other limitations and restrictions. Unless otherwise stated, promotions must be applied by you before checkout. For the avoidance of doubt, once checkout is completed, promotions cannot be applied to the same transaction. Take My Phone reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel or refuse promotions.</span><br><br>

<span id="faqq">Accuracy of all Information</span><br>
<span id="faqa">Take My Phone makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of all information you receive in relation to your Product. From time to time, however, there may be typographical errors, technical inaccuracies, pricing or other errors or omissions. As such, Take My Phone reserves the right, at any time prior to payment, to:<br>(a) Correct an error. <br>(b) Change the offer. In the event the Product has already been sent to Take My Phone, the changed offer will become a New Offer subject to the processes set forth in Section 9 and Section 10. Otherwise, the changed offer will be a re-issued original offer, which you may accept or reject. <br>(c) Void a transaction. If the Product was already sent to Take My Phone, Take My Phone will be deemed to have rejected the Product resulting in a Return Circumstance subject to Section 11.</span><br><br>
